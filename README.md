# Train
This is a project I worked on as part of my studies at FH Technikum Wien.

In this console-application it is possible to create a train with a maximum of 10 carriages.
Each carriage has either the type passenger, sleeper or diner and a sleeper carriage can only be added directly behind two passenger carriages.
You can choose each carriages' capacity and position in the train.
Furthermore, it is possible to print the train you have createt and it's stats.
